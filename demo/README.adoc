= NuBank Programming Challenge

This repo contains Clojure code for the NuBank Programming Challenge.  It is a basic
Ring/Compojure app which includes a number of unit tests and a simple main program.

== Prerequisites

You will need java 1.7+ and Leiningen 2 installed. The code was developed & tested on
Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) with these versions:
----
> lein --version
Leiningen 2.5.1 on Java 1.8.0_25 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
----

== Testing

Once you clone the repository, make sure you can run lein and execute the unit tests.  You
should see something like the following:
----
> lein deps
...
  <many jar's are downloaded>
...
> lein test
Initializing system state...

Ran 10 tests containing 87 assertions.

The last line "0 failures, 0 errors" is the important part.  If something is wrong 
with your config please shoot me a quick email and we'll resolve it.


== Running

To start a web server for the application, execute the following in a spare window:

    lein ring server
